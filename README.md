# snbank
The program consists of 9 functions:
getValInt() -- Compels the user to enter an integer value
getValFloat() -- Compels the user to enter a float vakue
get_username_password() -- Fetches the staff's username and password
staff_txt() -- Creates the files for storing the staff and customer data
chk_usrnm_psswrd() -- Authenticates the user
new_account() -- Creates a new bank account
acc_details() -- Displays a customer's details after receiving his/her account number
staff_ops() -- Lists the different operations that can be performed after a successful login
main() -- This is the function that kicks off the whole program (but you knew that).

I choose the functional approach because writing the program as a singular, homogenous entity would be arduous, and make it difficult to find and fix bugs
I wasn't quite sure what the session file should contain and why it should be deleted after loging out, but I coded that into the program.
